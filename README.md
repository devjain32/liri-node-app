# liri-node-app

This is the LIRI Node app. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

The app uses the Spotify, Bands In Town, and OMDB APIs to look up any song, artist, or movie and return information about it.

Begin any request with "node liri.js"

If you want to return song information, say "spotify-this-song [song title]"
If you want to return artist concert dates, say "concert-this [artist name]"
If you want to return movie information, say "movie-this [movie title]"
